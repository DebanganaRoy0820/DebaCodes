LOGIC FLOW:    1. BUILD PET'S MASTER(PTMASTER) KSDS FILE OF RECORD LENGTH 80 AND PRIMARY KEY AS PET-ID (3,0) AND ALTERNATE KEY AS PET-TYPE (1,0)
               2. POPULATE PTMASTER WITH REPRO 
               3. BUILD SALETRAN PS FILE WITH LRECL=80
               4. RECORD THE ORDERS IN ABOVE-MENTIONED FORMAT
               5. BUILD PROCSALE ESDS FILE WITH RECORD LENGTH 25 
               6. BUILD PENDSALE PS FILE WITH LRECL=80
               7. BUILD PLREP PS FILE WITH LRECL=80
               8. OPEN SALETRAN IN INPUT MODE
               9. OPEN PTMASTER IN I-O MODE
               10.OPEN PROCSALE IN OUTPUT/EXTEND MODE BASED ON CONDITION
               11.OPEN UNPROCESSED AS ABOVE.
               12.READ SALETRAN AND PTMASTER FOR PET-ID AND TYPE TO CHECK FOR QUANTITY.
               13.NOW COMPARE QUANTITY BOUGHT(QB) WITH QUANTITY AVAILABLE(QA). IF QB <= QA THEN SEND TO PROCSALE AND REWRITE PTMASTER, ELSE PENDSALE
               14.DO FOR EVERY ORDER ON SALETRAN
               15.IN PROCSALES CALCULATE TOTAL PROFIT/LOSS FOR THAT ORDER
               16.AFTER PROCESSING ALL RECORDS IN SALETRAN DISPLAY TOTAL PROFIT/LOSS FOR EACH TYPE IN PLREP
               17.FOR EVERY TIME PROFIT OF THREE BREEDS IS DONE GO TO NEXT PAGE.IF ONE TYPE IS ABSENT SKIP.SORTED BREEDWISE.
